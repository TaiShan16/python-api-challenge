# python-api-challenge

Part 1: WeatherPy
In this part, we use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the starter code, which generated about 600 cities of varying distances from the equator. Then, we create a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
Latitude vs. Temperature
Latitude vs. Humidity
Latitude vs. Cloudiness
Latitude vs. Wind Speed
Next step, we computed the linear regression for each relationship. Separate the plots into Northern Hemisphere (greater than or equal to 0 degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degrees latitude).


Part 2: VacationPy
In this part, we use weather data to plan future vacations. We use the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library to create map visualizations.
